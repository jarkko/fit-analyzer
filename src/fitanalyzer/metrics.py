Normalized Power (NP), Training Impulse (TRIMP), Training Stress Score (TSS),
and Intensity Factor (IF).

def np_power(power: pd.Series) -> float:
    """Calculate Normalized Power (NP) for cycling power data.

    Normalized Power is a weighted average of power output that better represents
    the physiological cost of variable-intensity cycling than simple average power.
    It uses a 30-second rolling average raised to the 4th power to emphasize
    hard efforts, making it more accurate for interval-based workouts.

    The algorithm:
    1. Calculate 30-second rolling average of power
    2. Raise each value to the 4th power
    3. Take the mean of these values
    4. Take the 4th root of the result

    Args:
        power: Series of power values in watts, typically at 1-second intervals.
               Can contain NaN values which will be handled gracefully.

    Returns:
        Normalized Power value in watts as a float. Returns np.nan if:
        - Input series is empty
        - All values are NaN
        - Calculation cannot be completed

    Example:
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> power_data = pd.Series([200, 250, 300, 200, 150])
        >>> np_power(power_data)
        223.6  # Example value, actual result may vary

) -> float:
    """Calculate Training Impulse (TRIMP) from heart rate data.

    TRIMP (Training Impulse) quantifies cardiovascular training load based on
    heart rate intensity and duration. It uses exponential weighting to emphasize
    time spent at higher intensities, providing a single metric for training stress.

    The algorithm uses Banister's exponential TRIMP formula:
    1. Calculate Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) = (HR - HR_rest) / (HR_max - HR_rest)
    2. Apply exponential weighting: 0.64 * exp(1.92 * HRR)
    3. Multiply by duration in minutes

    Args:
        hr: Series of heart rate values in beats per minute (bpm).
            Assumes 1-second sampling intervals. NaN values are dropped.
        hr_rest: Resting heart rate in bpm. Used to calculate heart rate reserve.
                 Default is DEFAULT_HR_REST from constants.
        hr_max: Maximum heart rate in bpm. Used to calculate heart rate reserve.
                Default is DEFAULT_HR_MAX from constants.

    Returns:
        TRIMP value as a float representing training load. Higher values indicate
        greater training stress. Returns 0.0 if:
        - Input series is empty
        - All values are NaN after cleaning
        - Duration is zero

    Example:
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> hr_data = pd.Series([140, 150, 160, 155, 145])
        >>> trimp_from_hr(hr_data, hr_rest=60, hr_max=190)
